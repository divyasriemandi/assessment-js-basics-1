// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "Gather requirements to implement business objectives"
const Design = "UI, Programming, Security, Commuincations, Architecture and Platforms"
const Implementation = "implementing the design"
const TestingAndIntegration = "Ensure that each function runs as it should and that each part of the application is interacting well with other parts"
const Maintain ="the final phase discovers bugs that slipped through the cracks during testing and resolves themâ€”this can start its own iterative process"
